Spotify Connect client for the Raspberry Pi that "just works" 
```

```ad-info
Raspotify is a [Debian package and associated repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)) for Debian Stable and other Debian Stable based/compatible OS’s which thinly wraps the awesome [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library by [Paul Lietar](https://github.com/plietar) and others up as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)).

Raspotify is primarily intended to be used in a _[headless enviroment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer)_.

_For desktop OS’s [spotifyd](https://spotifyd.github.io/spotifyd/installation/Raspberry-Pi.html) offers similar functionality and is probably a better choice._

If you’re looking for a turnkey audio solution for Raspberry Pi’s with Spotify Connect support we recommend [moOde™ audio player](https://moodeaudio.org/).
