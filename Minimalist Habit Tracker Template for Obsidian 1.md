# Minimalist Habit Tracker Template for Obsidian 1

In [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), there are usually many different ways to implement a feature that you would like to have in your vault. Habit tracking is a way to help you track and implement habits in your daily life.

Daily Notes
-----------

If you are already creating daily notes in Obsidian, via the [Daily Notes core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) or the [Periodic Notes community plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes), it makes sense to track your habits here as well. In order to accomplish this, we can leverage the power of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and templates to create a minimal dashboard for tracking our habitâ€™s progress for the week.

Moving forward, I will assume you have [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) or [Daily Notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) plugin enabled and configured with a template. You do not have to use the [Templater community plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), the [Templates core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) will work as well. I will be using Templater in the examples below, but you can sub out any of the special syntax for [Obsidian Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) equivalent.

Daily Note Template

Here is an example daily note template with Templater, which includes the habits we want to track:
